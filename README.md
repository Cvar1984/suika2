## Portability

In a strict sense, Suika2 runs on Windows, Mac, Web browsers, iPhone, iPad, Android, Linux, FreeBSD and NetBSD.

Suika2 consists of a platform independent part and a hardware abstraction layer (HAL). The platform independent part is written in ANSI C. HALs are currently written in C, Objective-C and Java.

If you want to port Suika2 to a new target platform, it is only necessary to write a HAL.
