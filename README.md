## Portability

The official builds of Suika2 run on Windows, Mac and Web browsers.
The source code can be compiled for iPhone, iPad, Android, Linux, FreeBSD and NetBSD.

Suika2 consists of the platform independent part and the hardware abstraction layer (HAL).
The platform independent part is written in ANSI C, the most portable language in the world.
HALs are currently written in C, C++, Objective-C and Java.

If you want to port Suika2 to a new target platform, it is only necessary to write a HAL.

## Suika2 Pro for Creators

[`Suika2 Pro for Creators`](https://github.com/suika2engine/suika2/wiki/6.-Suika2-Pro-for-Creators) is Suika2's sister application, a visual development tool for Windows and Mac that provides developers with a visual debugger and package export function.
