*Midori*Hello! Thank you for using Suika2!
*Midori*As you might know, Suika2 is a visual novel authoring tool.
*Midori*It's free and runs on both Windows and Mac. Awesome, right?

:L1_ADVANTAGE
Suika2 has three advantages. First of all, portability. We have Windows and Mac apps and a Web browser version. All of them work just the same way.
Game developers don't need to bother about the users' OSes.
In addition, game developers can use their favorite OS to develop a game.
Secondly, simplicity. Anyone can start writing scripts easily.
Last but not least, freedom. You can use Suika2 commercially for free.

:L1_ENV
For Windows, we support from old Windows XP to latest Windows 11.
For Mac, we support macOS 10.9 and later. We certainly support the latest Monterey release and M2 chip.
For Web browsers, we support Chrome, Safari, Firefox and Edge.
In addition, Suika2 runs on iPhone, iPad, Android and Linux. Actually, Suika2 was initially written on Linux!

:L2_OLD
Versions before 2.0.0 was named Suika Studio. The author developed it when he was just a high school student.
At 2.0.0, he removed the visual editor and "Studio" naming.

You can customize the engine with relatively little effort. This includes the font, text box and save screen.
